<h3>Who Are You?</h3>
<p>Greetings to the dearest wanderers of the Web! My name is Doyeop Lee and I'm currently an undergraduate majoring in business at Yonsei University.</p>
<br>
<h3>I see a lot of 'a-letheia' here. Is there any significant meaning to the word?</h3>
<p>The ancient Greek word 'aletheia(<span class="ipa">ἀλήθεια</span>)' which obtained its meaning of “truth” from the combination of the negation prefix 'a-(<span class="ipa">ἀ</span>)' and 'lethos(<span class="ipa">λῆθος</span>)' meaning “concealment, forgetfulness” is most likely the best word to describe the guiding principle of my life. That such integrity not only leads up to outstanding results but also brings about valuable lessons along the way, that blindly deceiving oneself into illusions of perfection notwithstanding the looming sense of anxiety and unconscious fear would always culminate in undesirable consequences I empirically learned from countless cases of successes and failures.</p>
<p>First on an academic level, I strive to leave no blind spots behind by boldly facing my problems and weaknesses. Struggling to fully grasp things I did not understand, thinking through logical loopholes so that my thoughts come into a more coherent picture, staying responsive to subconscious curiosities that arise while studying—despite being a rather simple set of rules, it is through these very processes that I was able to fully exploit my intellectual capacity and bring about the best results.</p>
<p>Second on a more general level regarding life as a whole, I try to stay as transparent and honest as possible to myself. If I come to be intuitively aware that there is something wrong going on, I attempt to boldly face those problems whatever they might be. If I ever find myself engulfed in the indolence of everydayness, I wake up myself and think of what I should do in order to simply ‘do my best.’</p>
<p>This life motto of mine is how I strived to live out my fullest potential, and how I will continue to do so in the future.</p>

<h3>What are 'inwards' and 'outwards'?</h3>
<p>This website(a-letheia.github.io/blog) largely comes in two parts. At 'inwards' I will be uploading articles mostly pertaining to philosophy or aesthetics, and at 'outwards' I will be writing on secular issues such as, but not limited to, economics. Please do bear in mind though that the 'outwards' part of the website is yet under construction.</p>
<h3>Any fields of interest?</h3>
<p>Philosophy(melancholy/madness/unconsciousness, Nietzsche, Greek tragedy, German idealism, Socrates), comparative linguistics & phonology(East/West Slavic, North Germanic, Semitic languages)</p>
