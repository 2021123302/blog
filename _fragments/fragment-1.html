header-title: (Frag)A Feminist Critique of Friedrich Schlegel’s ‘Passivity’ — Based on Friedrich Schlegel's Metaphysics
---
<p>The primary objective of this paper is to propose a new model upon which the feminist critique of Schlegel’s works could be unfolded, deriving from the fundamental thoughts that constitute Schlegel’s epistemological philosophy presented in his Jena lectures, fragments, and literary works such as Lucinde.</p>
